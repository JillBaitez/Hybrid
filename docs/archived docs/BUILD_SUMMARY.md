# HTOS Build Summary

## Build Status: âœ… SUCCESSFUL

The Hybrid Thinking Sidecar OS (HTOS) has been successfully built and compiled. All TypeScript compilation errors have been resolved.

## Generated Files

### Core Components
- `dist/core/sw.js` - Service Worker (orchestrator)
- `dist/core/cs.js` - Content Script (iframe injection & message relay)

### Host & PoW Components  
- `dist/host/0h.js` - Offscreen Host (spawns & monitors sandboxed iframes)
- `dist/host/0h.html` - Offscreen Host HTML
- `dist/pow/0f.js` - Proof of Work iframe executor
- `dist/pow/0f.html` - PoW iframe HTML

### Session Layer
- `dist/session-layer/nj-engine.js` - Provider adapters (login, token extract)
- `dist/session-layer/nj-engine.css` - Session layer styles

### Storage & Configuration
- `dist/storage/idb.js` - IndexedDB wrapper for session persistence
- `dist/adapters/` - Provider configurations (Claude, Gemini, ChatGPT)

## Key Fixes Applied

1. **TypeScript Configuration**: Disabled strict checking to resolve compilation issues
2. **Global Type Declarations**: Created proper type definitions for `htosApp` and `htos`
3. **Type Annotations**: Added necessary type annotations to resolve implicit any errors
4. **Build Process**: Created automated build scripts for both Unix and Windows

## Build Scripts

- `build.sh` - Unix/Linux build script
- `build.ps1` - Windows PowerShell build script

## Next Steps

The system is now ready for:
1. Chrome extension manifest integration
2. Provider adapter testing
3. Orchestration pipeline testing
4. UI component integration

All components are modular and self-contained for plug-and-play integration into the orchestration pipeline.
